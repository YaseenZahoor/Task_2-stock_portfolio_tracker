Create a stock portfolio tracker that allows users to manage a stock portfolio by adding, removing, and tracking the performance of stocks. A program designed to help users manage their investments in various stocks. This tool allows users to:
Add Stocks: Users can input the stock symbols and the number of shares they own to add them to their portfolio.
Remove Stocks: Users can specify which stocks they want to remove from their portfolio, either completely or partially by specifying the number of shares to sell.
Track Performance: The tool fetches real-time stock data using financial APIs.
The stock portfolio tracking tool aims to provide users with a convenient way to stay updated on their stock investments.
